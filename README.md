# Machine_Learning_Algorithms
This repository provides a mathematically grounded and implementation-oriented exploration of common Machine Learning algorithms.
This repository provides a mathematically grounded and implementation-oriented exploration of common Machine Learning algorithms.
Its goal is to bridge the gap between theory and practice by deriving algorithms from first principles and then translating those derivations into clear, efficient implementations.

Rather than treating ML models as black boxes, this repository focuses on:

* **Step-by-step derivations** of learning rules and loss functions
* **From-scratch implementations** to expose internal mechanics
* **Practical project examples** that demonstrate real-world usage
